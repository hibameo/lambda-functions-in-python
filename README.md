# lambda functions

## Description
A brief description of your project. Explain what it does and why it is useful.

## Features
- Uses Python lambda functions for concise and efficient operations.
- Implements functional programming techniques like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
- Provides examples of lambda usage in sorting, condition checking, and mathematical calculations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the application using the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Example Lambda Functions
#### 1️⃣ Simple Addition
```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
```

#### 2️⃣ Using `map()` to Square Numbers
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

#### 3️⃣ Filtering Even Numbers
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(evens)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
